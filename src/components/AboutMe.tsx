      <p>
        I am a passionate and dedicated software developer with experience in
        building web applications using React. I have a strong foundation in
        JavaScript and TypeScript, and I enjoy working on challenging projects
        that push the boundaries of what is possible.

        In my free time, I like to explore new technologies and contribute to
        open-source projects. I am a quick learner and always strive to improve
        my skills. I believe in writing clean and maintainable code that is easy
        to understand and collaborate on.
